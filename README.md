# Data-Science-Portfolio

Hi! I recently undertook a strong interest in Data Science. I followed different online courses and enjoyed the Machine Leanring course from Andrew NG on Coursera. I am currently learning more about Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib,Seaborn..) used in data science to clean, process and visualise data. One month ago, I signed up for Dataquest missions and will upload my work on Github to create a portfolio and share some Dataquest projects.
