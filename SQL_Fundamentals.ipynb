    "The most common way to join data using SQL is using an inner join. The syntax for an inner join is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inner Join\n",
    "\n",
    "An inner join works by including only rows from each table that have a match as specified using the ON clause. \n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT [column_names] FROM [table_name_one]\n",
    "\n",
    "INNER JOIN [table_name_two] ON [join_constraint];`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's use the facebook.db database which contains:\n",
    "* facts table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * name -- the name of the country.\n",
    "    * area -- the total land and sea area of the country.\n",
    "    * population -- the population of the country.\n",
    "    * birth_rate -- the birth rate of the country.\n",
    "    * created_at -- the date the record was created.\n",
    "    * updated_at -- the date the record was updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cities table\n",
    "\n",
    "    * id - A unique ID for each city.\n",
    "    * name - The name of the city.\n",
    "    * population - The population of the city.\n",
    "    * capital - Whether the city is a capital city: 1 if it is, 0 if it isn't.\n",
    "    * facts_id - The ID of the country, from the facts table.\n",

    "we can see that there are some countries in the facts table that don't have corresponding cities in the cities table (261 versus 210), which indicates we may have some incomplete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a query to explore the missing data using a left join.\n",
    "\n",
    "A left join includes all the rows that an inner join will select, plus any joins from the first (or left) table that don't have a match in the second table. \n",
    "\n",

    "Let's consider the following fields in a given table recent_grads:\n",

    "* Major_code - The major's code or ID\n",
    "* Major - The name of the major\n",
    "* Major_category - The broader category the major belongs to\n",
    "* Total - The total number of people who studied the major\n",
    "* Employed - The number of employed graduates\n",
    "\n",
    "The GROUP BY SQL statement allows us to compute summary statistics by \"group,\" or unique value. When we use this statement, SQL creates a group for each unique value in a column or set of columns (the same values we get when we use the DISTINCT statement), and then does the calculations for them.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Having SQL Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to filter on a column generated by a query, we can use the HAVING statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT Major_category, AVG(Employed) / AVG(Total) AS share_employed \n",
